## Project Descreption
This project is a fully complete functional project having the static HTML & CSS files along with the recently added javaScript, all together combined to result in this final look of our Weather-Journal App that allows users to enter the zip code of any city or country, their feelings and the app will print out the weather of that city, the name of the city, the current date of the day and finally the feelings entered by the user to the app. This project has been built using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Usage
You can use this project eaisly after downlodaing it by navigating project folders and files and open them using editor, there is a website folder having a style.css file, an app.js file, the file of HTML as index.html. And finally a file outside the website folder called server.js . 

## Installation
you can install this project either by:
* clonning the remote repository to your local machine so that you can follow along. To clone, you can use `(https://github.com/MarianWadia/Udacity-Weather-Journal-App.git)` command on your terminal. When you clone a remote repository, you get an identical copy locally, where you can make desired changes.
* Fork the remote repository to your own online account. When you fork a remote repository, a new duplicate copy of the remote repository is created in your account.

## Project Dependencies
There are some dependencies to that project we have nodes.js and some of its packages as cors, express and body-parser as they should be installed in order for the project to work properly and effeciently. Moreover we hav used OpenWeatherMap.com to be able populating the data to and from it to our app.

## Development
We can add and modify the code with maybe some other fetures on coming development stages of the project but here we keep it simple as our app prints out the current date by using the global object `new Date()`, the felings user has entered through our app textarea, finally and the most intersting part is that it brings out for the user the city name and temprature from the API we used OpenWeatherMap.com as we mentioned before.
